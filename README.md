# Event Scheduling App

This is a Flutter-based event scheduling app that allows users to easily add, view, and manage tasks with associated dates and times. Key features include:

- **Task Management**: View tasks in a sorted `ListView`, with each task displayed as a card containing the task description and date.
- **Add Task**: Navigate to a separate page to enter new tasks, select a date, and set a time.
- **Task Completion**: Long press a task to open a dialog with options to mark it as completed, changing its background color to teal for visual distinction.

The app uses `DateTime` objects to manage task dates and leverages Flutter widgets like `Card`, `ListTile`, and `AlertDialog` for a user-friendly experience.
